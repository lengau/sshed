This is a quick, basic description of the communications protocol used on an
sshedit pipe. The motivation behind this file is to allow others to implement
compatible sshedit programs in the language of their choice.

Version numbers should be used whenever incompatible changes are made to the
way sshedit passes a file over the socket. I'm already planning incompatible
changes (e.g. sending only modifications over the wire rather than sending
the entire file both ways), so I wanted to be prepared.

Versions marked as deprecated are no longer implemented by the most recent
versions of sshedit.

ALL VERSIONS:
All versions of the sshedit protocol must begin with the version number written
as a string, followed by a newline.

Version 1:
The host side (the remote machine where `sshedit filename` is run) simply
declares the protocol version and the client (local machine) must implement it.
Host: open socket
Host: write a line containing '1'.
Host: write a line containing the filename converted to bytes.
Host: write a line the size (in bytes) of the file as a string
Host: write the file.
Client: write the modified file.
