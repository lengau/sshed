# SSHEd

SSHEd is a small connector program that allows you to use a local text editor
or IDE to edit files on a remote server without having to manually copy the
file to the local machine. More importantly, sshedit gets run from the remote
machine.

This means it can be used as a drop-in replacement for ed, emacs, nano, vi, etc.
on remote machines over SSH.
